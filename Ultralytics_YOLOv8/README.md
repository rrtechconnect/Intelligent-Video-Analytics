**Ultralytics YOLOv8** is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics.

Designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. 

It can be trained on large datasets and is capable of running on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.

***A Brief History of YOLO***

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a popular object detection and image segmentation model developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington. 

YOLO first version-2015: high speed and accuracy.

YOLOv2-2016: Improved version with batch normalization, anchor boxes, and dimension clusters. 

YOLOv3-2018: Improved model's performance with more efficient backbone network, adding a feature pyramid, and making use of focal loss.

YOLOv4-2020: More innovations such as the use of Mosaic data augmentation, a new anchor-free detection head, and a new loss function.

YOLOv5-Ultralytics-2021: improved the model's performance and added new features such as support for panoptic segmentation and object tracking.

YOLOv8-Ultralytics-2022:   SOTA model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility.Key features are extensibility, strong backbone network and a number of innovative features.

**Major Application areas of YOLO are**

Autonomous vehicles

Security and surveillance
