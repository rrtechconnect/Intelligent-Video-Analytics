***Intelligent Video Analytics in Smart-City, Safe-City, Smart Parking, Surveillance and Security.***

The Computer Vision & AI has been playing tremendous role in shaping the cities around the world to provide best living expereince to citizens. The smart-cities being the heart of any country, leveraging the AI in building the smarter and safer spaces is of paramount importance to any city governance or the administration bodies.

During my professional acquaintance with multiple companies handling different smart-city, safecity and security projects, I had come across several challenging use-cases that the city administration bodies comes up with to solve using AI/CV techniques. Though, the AI has matured enough to deal with certain use-cses with acceptable accuracy, still there are lots of unsolved issues due to many reasons of it's own.

Herewith, I would like to list the challenging use-cases that are requiring the innovative model developments/explorations with performance and cost optimizations, given the shortcomings/limitations of the current state-of-the-art AI algorithms/models and the difficulties in obtaining the use-cse specific data.

The major use-cases are as follows:

1. Face Recognition (FRS)
2. Automatic Number Plate Detection(ANPR)
3. Advanced Intrusion Detction
4. Abandoned Object Detection
5. Debris/Litter Detection
6. Red-light violatio detection
7. Gunshot detection
8. **Graffiti Detection**
9. Vandalism Detection
10. Traffic Congestion Detection
11. Vehicle count Detection
12. Vehicle Break down detection
13. Accident Detection
14. **Fight/Voilence Detection**
15. **Person Collapse Detection**
16. Crowd Detection
17. Crowd behaviour Analysis
18. Eve Teasing detection
19. Chain Snatching Detection
20. Smart Parking- Emplot solt Detection and Management
21. Vehicle make recognition
22. Vehicle type recognition
23. Vehicle color detection
24. Ambulance caught in Traffic detection
25. Overspeeding detection
26. No-helmet detection
27. Traffic Queue length Detection
28. Vehicle Average Speed Detection
29. Pothole detection
30. No-Seatbelt Detection
31. Triple Riding Detection
32. Loitering Detection
33. Advanced Drone video Analytics
